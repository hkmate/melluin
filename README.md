## About Nevetnik√©k foundation

We are for to help the sick children to get better faster 
or make their time not so bad in the hospital.

There are three main activities in the foundation:
1. We visit the inpatient children in the hospital and make fun with them. 
We do puppetry, playing cards, board games, magic, singing together, handicraft, or just a conversation; 
Anything that make them happier.  
2. We make handmade toys (mostly from wood) and put to a treasure chest for those kids who are 
not inpatient but went to the hospital for an examination or treatment.
3. We paint walls in the departments of the children hospital. We call it fairy-tale-walls because
we change the plain white, boring, sterile walls to a fairy tale with forests, elves, dwarfs, animals and so on.

## About this project

You may think "Ok, that's good, but why do you need an application". Well, for the most proficient
visits we need administration about the last time when another volunteer 
was in the departments and what's about our toolbox there. Before this app we did this administration with emailing 
and exercise books for logging.

This application provides real-time information about current and planned visits, about toolboxes, 
and can create reports.
In the future, there will be more functionality to help the administration.
